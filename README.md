PyProgMusic
===========

There are those of us who cannot play any kind of musical intrument.
However, music and even what music sounds good together is simply math,
something that programmers are usually good at. Music also has a lot of
repetition in it. But as programmers, we us try to keep things DRY by
using functions and classes. So why can't music be described the same way
as a computer program?
